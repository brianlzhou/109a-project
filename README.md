# Modeling the Federal Funds Rate
Final project for Harvard's CS 109a/209a
Michael McPhie, Zani Xu, and Brian Zhou

In this project, we used various data science techniques to develop predictive models of the monthly changes in the Federal Funds Rate. We investigated the following questions:

1. Which economic indicators are most significant for predicting the changes that the Federal Reserve Bank makes to the target Federal Funds Rate (FFR)?
2. To what extent are these changes predictable based on economic indicators such as the inflation rate, unemployment, changes in consumer spending and investment, and market expectations?
